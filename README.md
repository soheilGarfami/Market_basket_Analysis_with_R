=======

The steps we will follow are:  
  * Describe the dataset used for market basket analysis 
  * Pose relevant questions related to the customer and purchase data  
  * Process, analyze, model and visualize the data to answer these questions 
  * Provide insights into the use of Market Basket Analysis and why it is appropriate for this dataset

We will describe the analysis and findings by clearly connecting the business questions to the data used

* ## [Market_basket_analysis.md](2_Market_basket_analysis.md)
in the second kernel ***Market_basket_analysis.md*** we will dive deeper by applying the Apriori algorithm to uncover valuable associations within the data.

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique used to uncover relationships between items in large datasets, often within transactional data from retail environments. By analyzing patterns in customer purchases, MBA helps businesses understand which products are frequently bought together. This insight allows companies to optimize product placement, design targeted marketing strategies, and improve cross-selling and upselling opportunities.

**Usage of Market Basket Analysis:**
1. **Product Placement:** Arrange related products near each other to boost sales.
2. **Promotion Strategies:** Create combo offers for products that are frequently purchased together.
3. **Inventory Management:** Ensure frequently paired items are stocked together.
4. **Customer Segmentation:** Identify customer groups based on buying habits to tailor marketing efforts.
