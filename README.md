The steps we will follow are:  \
  * Describe the dataset used for market basket analysis \
  * Pose relevant questions related to the customer and purchase data  \
  * Process, analyze, model and visualize the data to answer these questions \
  * Provide insights into the use of Market Basket Analysis and why it is appropriate for this dataset

We will describe the analysis and findings by clearly connecting the business questions to the data used
